## Graz University Lecture "Signal Theory and Signal Processing" 2019

This are my solutions to the exercises as [Python/Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) notebooks.
Python, Jupyter, [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/),
and [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/) are required.
All these packages are included in the major scientific Python distributions like,
e.g., [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
